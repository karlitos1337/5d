## 2024-05-22 - Pandas Iteration
**Learning:** Iterating through Pandas DataFrames with `iterrows()` or `apply()` is significantly slower than vectorized operations.
**Action:** Always prefer vectorized operations or `numpy` arrays for calculations on large datasets. Use `df['col'] = df['col'] * 2` instead of loop.

## 2024-05-22 - API Timeouts
**Learning:** External API requests without timeouts can hang indefinitely, causing performance issues and potential DOS vulnerabilities.
**Action:** Always add `timeout` parameter to `requests` calls (e.g., `requests.get(url, timeout=10)`).

## 2024-05-23 - Redis Caching
**Learning:** Redis connections can fail. Hard dependencies on Redis for caching can bring down the application.
**Action:** Implement fallback mechanisms. If Redis is down, bypass cache or use local memory, but don't crash. Use a wrapper class to handle connection errors gracefully.

## 2024-05-24 - Vitest and Playwright Conflict
**Learning:** `vitest` runs all files matching `*.spec.js` by default, including Playwright E2E tests which fail in a unit test environment.
**Action:** When running unit tests in `web/5d-map`, explicitly specify the test files (e.g., `vitest run tests/unit.spec.js`) or configure exclusion patterns to avoid running E2E tests accidentally.
