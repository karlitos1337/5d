## 2024-05-23 - Micro-UX in Streamlit
**Learning:** Streamlit metrics lack built-in explanations by default, making dashboards confusing for new users. Adding `help` tooltips to `st.metric` is a high-impact, low-effort micro-UX win.
**Action:** When working on Streamlit dashboards, always check if metrics are self-explanatory. If not, add context via the `help` parameter. Also, `st.toast` is great for feedback on long-running processes.

## 2024-10-24 - Initial State Synchronization
**Learning:** Reliance on JS to set initial ARIA states (like `aria-pressed`) creates a gap where screen readers report incorrect states during loading. Progressive enhancement isn't just for no-JS; it's for *slow* JS too.
**Action:** Always hardcode valid initial ARIA attributes in HTML that match the visual "default" state, rather than waiting for `init()` logic to apply them.

## 2024-05-22 - Skip Link Implementation
**Learning:** Even single-page map applications need skip links because the header controls can be dense and repetitive for keyboard users.
**Action:** Always check for `main` content accessibility and provide a bypass mechanism for repeated navigation blocks.

## 2024-12-21 - React Dashboard Accessibility
**Learning:** React Single Page Applications (SPAs) often miss basic accessibility features like "Skip to content" links and ARIA labels on icon-only buttons, which are critical for keyboard and screen reader users. Adding these is a low-effort, high-impact improvement.
**Action:** When auditing React apps, immediately check for skip links and ensure all icon-only buttons (like dark mode toggles) have descriptive `aria-label` attributes.
